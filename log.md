# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 7th, 2017, Friday

**Progress Today**: I set up Git Bash today so I can use it and get more familiar with the commands. Spent way longer than needed fooling around with it before actually coding. I started off going through FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design section since it's relevant to what I'm learning at Flatiron. I finished the HTML5 and CSS portions and have completed [73] challenges currently. After that, I moved on to Flatiron School's Full-Stack Web Developer curriculum and finished up the Responsive Layout portion. That particular section included some lessons and two labs - Adding Responsive Features and Animal Save. It basically taught how to use media queries so that your website looks good on any device.

**Feelings**: I'm a little disappointed I got a late start today. I'll make up for it by starting earlier tomorrow.
