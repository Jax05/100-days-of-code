# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 7th, 2017, Friday

**Progress Today**: I set up Git Bash today so I can use it and get more familiar with the commands. Spent way longer than needed fooling around with it before actually coding. I started off going through FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design section since it's relevant to what I'm learning at Flatiron. I finished the HTML5 and CSS portions and have completed [73] challenges currently. After that, I moved on to Flatiron School's Full-Stack Web Developer curriculum and finished up the Responsive Layout portion. That particular section included some lessons and two labs - Adding Responsive Features and Animal Save. It basically taught how to use media queries so that your website looks good on any device.

**Feelings/Thoughts**: I'm a little disappointed I got a late start today. I'll make up for it by starting earlier tomorrow.

**Sites I'm Using**: <br />

### Day 2: July 8th, 2017, Saturday

**Progress Today**: Today I nearly finished the Bootstrap Framework section for Flatiron. I completed a few lessons and a couple of labs. We were essentially converting our previously made responsive site into one made with Bootstrap. I started off by downloading Bootstrap and adding it into a new project folder with the site's images and video. Next, I coded the entire layout of the site and added some of my own custom CSS.

### Day 3: July 9th, 2017, Sunday

**Progress Today**: I kind of waited until the last minute to get my minimum hour of code in. I completed about half of the Applied Visual Design section at FreeCodeCamp. I went from [73] challenges completed to [105]. The whole section takes an estimated 5 hours to finish.

**Feelings/Thoughts**: I got a ton of support on Twitter after tweeting about my progress, and it made me feel really good. Definitely a confidence boost. I'm trying to take these days one at a time and not stress about having days where I don't get as much done as I'd like to.

### Day 4: July 10th, 2017, Monday

**Progress Today**: I started coding on FreeCodeCamp when I got home from work. Today I finished the Applied Visual Design section and learned how to transform and animate elements. I've completed up to challenge [126] on that site. Afterward, I logged into Learn.co and wrapped up the Responsive Design section as well. I'm officially done with the basic HTML and CSS part of the curriculum. Now it's on to Procedural Ruby!

**Feelings/Thoughts**: I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of Bootstrap and how to make responsive sites. I'm planning on practicing my skills in the near future. I came up with a few project ideas I'd like to complete. All in all, today was a good day.

### Day 5: July 11th, 2017, Tuesday

**Progress Today**: I finished the first part of the Procedural Ruby section for Flatiron today. It was comprised of 6 labs and 7 lessons.
