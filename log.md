# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 7th, 2017, Friday

**Progress Today**: I set up Git Bash today so I can use it and get more familiar with the commands. Spent way longer than needed fooling around with it before actually coding. I started off going through FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design section since it's relevant to what I'm learning at Flatiron. I finished the HTML5 and CSS portions and have completed [73] challenges currently. After that, I moved on to Flatiron School's Full-Stack Web Developer curriculum and finished up the Responsive Layout portion. That particular section included some lessons and two labs - Adding Responsive Features and Animal Save. It basically taught how to use media queries so that your website looks good on any device.

**Feelings/Thoughts**: I'm a little disappointed I got a late start today. I'll make up for it by starting earlier tomorrow.

### Day 2: July 8th, 2017, Saturday

**Progress Today**: Today I nearly finished the Bootstrap Framework section for Flatiron. I completed a few lessons and a couple of labs. We were essentially converting our previously made responsive site into one made with Bootstrap. I started off by downloading Bootstrap and adding it into a new project folder with the site's images and video. Next, I coded the entire layout of the site and added some of my own custom CSS.
